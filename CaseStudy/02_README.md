 # components
 
 ## Water pump.
* This circulates the water through the machine, rotating in two directions. 
 * It’s used for circulating the water through the wash cycle and also for draining the water during the spin cycle. 

## Water inlet control valve. 
This is located near the water inlet point, which is opens and closes automatically when you load the clothes, depending on how much water is required. 

## Drum. 
* the clothes are loaded is the inner drum, which moves around the washing machine and is perforated with holes to allow the water in and out.
*  The outer tub contains the inner drum and the water, stopping it from leaking into the rest of the machine and supports the inner drum. 

## Agitator or paddles.
* This is located inside the tub of the washing machine and helps perform the cleaning of the clothes.
*  Most fully-automatic washing machines have these paddles on the rotating inner drum which is controlled by a rotating disc, whereas semi-automatic washing machines use an       agitator that rotates within the machine to produce a current in the machine.
*  Either way, these are designed to move the clothes around during the wash to allow the detergent to work and remove dirt particles and soiling from your clothes, helping the clothes rub together while washing. 

## Washing machine motor. 
This is combined with the agitator or the disc that turns the drum, it produces a rotator motion. This is basically the mechanism that gets your machine going. 

## Drain pipe.
All the dirty water from your washing is expelled from the machine via the drain pipe. 

## Printed circuit board (PCB).
This is where you’ll find mainly the electronics that operate the machine from electrical components to circuits. These can be programmed and help operate the machine, acting as the artificial intelligence for the washing machine, sometimes even deciding on the time needed for rinsing or washing. 

## Timer. 
This helps set the wash time for your clothes, which can be set manually or automatically. 

## Heating element.
This heats the water up in the washing machine to the desired temperature.
