Algorithm:
Step1: we are going to connect the LDR one pin to five potential unit of every LDR
and another pin of LDR will go to the four analog pin of the microcontroller.

Step2:
The microcontroller can calculate the typical voltage to LDR of every section such
top to Bottom to left and Right .

Step3: From there microcontroller can commit to rotate the servo in step with the
difference of 2 averages such prime and bottom average distinction and left right
average distinction.

Step4: in step with the difference the position of servo are going to be
