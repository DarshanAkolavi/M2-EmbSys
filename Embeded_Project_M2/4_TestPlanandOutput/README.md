 ## Algorithm
 
Step1:start

step2: LDR Sesnser sense the solar irradiations and gives the input to the MCU.

Step3: we are going to connect the LDR one pin to five potential units of every LDR

step4: another pin of LDR will go to the four analog pins of the microcontroller.

Step5:The microcontroller can calculate the typical voltage to LDR of every section such top to Bottom to left and Right.

Step6: From there microcontroller can commit to rotating the servo in step with the difference of 2 averages such prime and bottom average distinction and left right average distinction.

Step7: in step with the difference the position of servo are going to be

step8: Stop
