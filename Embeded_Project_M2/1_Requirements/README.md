# SUN TRACKING SOLAR PANEL
 
 ##
 * To track the sun's position and rotate the panel according to the sun's position and receive the
    sunlight at its fullest potential during the daytime.
 * Solar panel absorbs the energy from the Sun, converts it into electrical energy and stores the energy in a battery.            
 * The position of the Sun with respect to the solar panel is not fixed due to the rotation of the Earth. For an efficient usage of the solar energy, the Solar panels should absorb energy to a maximum extent.           
 * This can be done only if the panels are continuously placed towards the direction of the Sun. So, solar panel should continuously rotate in the direction of Sun.

 # Working Of Solar panel Tracker 
 
 * The Sun tracking solar panel consists of two LDRs, solar panel and a servo motor and ATmega328 Micro controller.
 * Two light dependent resistors are arranged on the edges of the solar panel. 
 * Light dependent resistors produce low resistance when light falls on them. The servo motor connected to the panel rotates the panel in the direction of Sun. 
 * Panel is arranged in such a way that light on two LDRs is compared and panel is rotated towards LDR which have high intensity i.e. low resistance compared to other. 
 * Servo motor rotates the panel at certain angle.
 * When the intensity of the light falling on right LDR is more, panel slowly moves towards right and if intensity on the left LDR is more, panel slowly moves towards left. 
 * In the noon time, Sun is ahead and intensity of light on both the panels is same. In such cases, panel is constant and there is no rotation.


## High Level Requirement :
  * ATMEGA328
  * LDR Sensers
  * Servo Motor And DC Motor
  * Solar Panel
 
 ## Low Level Requirements :
  * transistors
  * Spectrum Analyzer
  * resistrors
  * Push Button
  
 
 ## Components Required :

 ## ATMEGA328
   * ATmega328 is an AVR family micro controller. It is based on advanced RISC architecture.
   * It is an 8-bit controller. It has 32K Bytes of Programmable Flash memory, 1K Bytes of EEPROM and 2K Bytes of SRAM.
   * It has 23 programmable I/O pins. It supports peripheral features like two 8-bit timers, one 16-bit timer, 6 channel ADC with 10-bit resolution, programmable USART, Serial      Peripheral Interface, 2 wire serial interface (I2C), etc.
  
 ## Sensors:
  * Light Dependent Resistors or LDRs are the resistors whose resistance values depend on intensity of the light.
  *  As the intensity of light falling on the LDR increases, resistance value decreases. In dark, LDR will have maximum resistance. 
  *  LDR will output an analog value which should be converted to digital. This can be done using analog to digital converter.
 
 ## Solar Panel
 
 * Solar panel is placed on a piece of cardboard (just for demonstration) and the bottom of the cardboard is connected to Servo motor. 
 * Solar panel consists of photovoltaic cells   arranged in an order. Photovoltaic cell is nothing but a solar cell.
 *  Solar cell is made up of semiconductor material silicon.

 ## switch or gate for electronic signals.
 
 * transistor, semiconductor device for amplifying, controlling, and generating electrical signals.
 * we think that BC547 is a normal NPN (Negative-Positive-Negative) junction transistor. 
   
## Servo Motor
* Servo motor is used to rotate the panel. To drive the servo motor, a PWM Signal must be provided to its control pin and hence Pin 17 (which has PWM) is connected to the control pin of the servo motor.
* By connecting a battery to the solar panel, you can store the energy generated by the solar cells and this energy can be used when required.
*  There are separate charge controller circuits dedicated to efficiently control the charge acquired from solar panels and charge the batteries.

## Resistors.
  
 * A resistor is a passive two-terminal electrical component that implements electrical resistance as a circuit element.
 * In electronic circuits, resistors are used to reduce current flow, adjust signal levels, to divide voltages, bias active elements, and terminate transmission lines,             among other uses.
* Resistors are common elements of electrical networks and electronic circuits and are ubiquitous in electronic equipment. 
* Practical resistors as discrete components can be composed of various compounds and forms.
*  Resistors are also implemented within integrated circuits.
